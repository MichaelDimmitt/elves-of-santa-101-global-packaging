Elves of santa 101, global packaging.

This repository is purposely kept simple as a hello world template to enable others to allow other elves to join team North-Pole and publish global packages.

This is one way to create a global package, in the future this repo will suport other global install implementations. If they exist.

The current implementation was sourced from: https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/393/how-to-create-a-global-module-for-node-js-properly

This program is helpful for an experiment that I am working on for my screensaver application:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/aerial_desktop
